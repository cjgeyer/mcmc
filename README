The PDF's for the vignettes are not in the git repo.
In order to avoid errors in check must first do

    cd package/mcmc/inst/doc
    make R_HOME=`R RHOME`

To check do

    cd package
    rm -rf mcmc/src/*.{o,so}
    R CMD check mcmc

Since one of the vignettes takes a long time, probably want

    rm -rf mcmc/src/*.{o,so}
    R CMD check --no-vignettes mcmc

except for one last check before push
