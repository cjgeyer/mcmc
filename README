The main branch is morph (not master).  We will probably never go back
to master being the main branch.

This is the source tree for the R contributed package mcmc.
The version for users is at CRAN (http://cran.r-project.org/package=mcmc)

This package suggests packages Iso and xtable.  So if don't have need to
add to R.  In R do

    install.packages(c("Iso", "xtable"))

The PDF's for the vignettes are not in the git repo.
In order to avoid errors in check must first do

    pushd package/mcmc/inst/doc
    make R_HOME=`R RHOME`
    popd

To check do

    cd package
    rm -rf mcmc/src/*.{o,so}
    R CMD check mcmc

Since one of the vignettes takes a long time, probably want

    rm -rf mcmc/src/*.{o,so}
    R CMD check --no-vignettes mcmc

except for one last check before push
