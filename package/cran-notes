For version 0.9-6

This version was requested by CRAN to fix "additional issues" in file rchk
about not enough PROTECT's in C called via .Call.  Those issues are (I hope)
fixed.

Also remove dependence on R package compiler.  (Now rely on JIT.)

Also improve vignette.

Reverse dependencies check has been run
    library(tools); check_packages_in_dir(".", reverse = "all")
and problems found are not my fault
in CRAN package MCMCpack installed size is too big
in CRAN package sizeMat the DESCRIPTION file says Imports: mcmc but
    nothing is actually imported, so this shouldn't even be a reverse
    dependency
