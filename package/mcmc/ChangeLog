 0.4.1 fixed documentation for metrop

 0.5   changed licence to X11 (was AFL, which apparently sucks)

       changed to NAMESPACE
       cleaned up latex in inst/doc, added Makefile
       removed src/Makevars

       had to get rid of R_IsNaNorNA in src/metrop.c

       generally, lots of changes to get ready for CRAN

       all of the tests/*.Rout.save redone because the digits
       in numerical printing seem to have changed -- cannot get
       bit for bit identical with earlier R (even before code changes).

       changed first arg of metrop from "o" to "obj"
