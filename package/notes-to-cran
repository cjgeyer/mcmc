This is a submission to get unorphaned and also to add calls
R_CheckUserInterrupt(); in each iteration of long-running operations.

The ## IGNORE_RDIFF_BEGIN and ## IGNORE_RDIFF_END put into two test
files (initseq.R and logit.R) by the orphaner have been preserved in
this submission (in fact those files are the same in R versions 0.9.6.1,
the orphaned version, and in 0.9-7, this submission).
AFAICS this is all the orphaner did except for changes to the DESCRIPTION
file.

All reverse dependencies check with only a note about one of them
having too large installed size.
